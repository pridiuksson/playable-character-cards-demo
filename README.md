# Playable Character Cards: Headless AI Engine Architecture

## What Are Playable Character Cards?

**Playable Character Cards** is an AI-powered platform for creating and interacting with conversational AI characters. Users design character "cards" with unique personalities, backstories, and specific goals, then other users engage with these characters through goal-oriented conversational mini-games.

Each character interaction is a structured conversation where the AI maintains character consistency while working toward a defined objective (teaching a concept, solving a problem, providing therapy, etc.). The system tracks conversation progress and determines when goals are achieved.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Educational characters (a medieval alchemist teaching chemistry)
- Therapeutic guides (mindfulness coaches with specific wellness goals)
- Historical figures (Napoleon discussing military strategy)
- Problem-solving mentors (fairy tale characters teaching mathematics)

## Technical Overview: Headless AI Engine Architecture

This document outlines the backend system architected as a **Headless AI Content Engine**. The system provides a production-ready JSON API specifically designed for consumption by declarative UI generation platforms and AI-powered development tools such as [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) - a vibe coding tool known for crafting web apps with beautiful UI/UX.

**Core Design Philosophy:** Complete decoupling of AI-powered content generation from frontend presentation. This enables frontend platforms to focus exclusively on translating API contracts into beautiful user interfaces while the backend handles AI integration complexity, security, and scalability.

**Result:** A single, sophisticated backend powering unlimited frontend variations—therapy applications, educational games, entertainment platforms, and specialized tools—all consuming the same robust API infrastructure.

### 2.2. Database Schema & Security Model

**Core Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Primary data table with Row-Level Security
CREATE TABLE cards (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  description text NOT NULL,     -- Character personality & background
  goal text NOT NULL,           -- Conversation objective
  image_url text               -- Supabase Storage URL
);

-- RLS Policy: Public read access only
CREATE POLICY "Public cards are viewable by everyone" 
ON cards FOR SELECT 
USING (true);

-- RLS Policy: Admin-only writes (enforced via shared secret)
CREATE POLICY "Admin-only card creation"
ON cards FOR INSERT
USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

**Dual Authentication Model:**
- **Public Operations:** Anonymous access through Supabase's RLS system
- **Admin Operations:** Bearer token authentication with custom shared secret
- **Data Governance:** PostgreSQL enforces access control at the database level

### 2.3. AI Adapter Pattern Implementation

**Modular AI Integration Architecture:**
```
supabase/functions/_shared/ai_adapters/
├── gemini_2_5_flash_adapter.ts    # Conversational AI
├── imagen_3_adapter.ts            # Character artwork generation  
├── imagen_4_adapter.ts            # Advanced image generation
└── [future_adapters...]           # OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
```

**Adapter Interface Contract:**
```typescript
// Chat adapters implement this interface
export async function getChatCompletion(promptObject: ChatPrompt): Promise<ChatResponse> {
  // Model-specific implementation with:
  // - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  // - Response validation and parsing
  // - Error handling and fallback strategies
}

// Image adapters implement this interface  
export async function generateImage(prompt: string): Promise<ImageResponse> {
  // Model-specific implementation with:
  // - Quality optimization (1024x1024 → 512x512)
  // - Format standardization (JPEG, 80% quality)
  // - Base64 handling and Buffer conversion
}
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Zero-downtime model switching:** Change AI providers via import statement
- **Provider isolation:** Model-specific logic contained within adapters
- **Consistent interfaces:** Business logic independent of AI provider details
- **Extensibility:** New AI models integrate in minutes, not weeks

## 3. Practical Integration: Implementation Examples

### 3.1. Complete API Integration Patterns

**Basic Character Browsing & Selection:**
```javascript
// 1. Fetch available characters with pagination
async function loadCharacters(page = 1, pageSize = 20) {
  const response = await fetch(`/get-public-cards?page=${page}&pageSize=${pageSize}`);
  return await response.json();
}

// 2. Get detailed character information
async function getCharacterDetails(cardId) {
  const response = await fetch(`/get-card-details?id=${cardId}`);
  return await response.json();
}

// Example response structure:
// {
//   "id": "123",
//   "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z", 
//   "description": "A wise medieval alchemist...",
//   "goal": "Teach chemistry through magical storytelling",
//   "image_url": "https://storage.url/character.jpg"
// }
```

**AI Conversation Implementation:**
```javascript
// 3. Real-time AI conversation with goal tracking
async function playTurn(cardId, userMessage) {
  const response = await fetch('/play-turn', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      card_id: cardId,
      user_message: userMessage
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  // result contains:
  // {
  //   "card_id": "123",
  //   "card_description": "A wise medieval alchemist...",
  //   "card_goal": "Teach chemistry...", 
  //   "user_message": "Can you help me understand reactions?",
  //   "ai_response": "Ah, young apprentice! Let me show you...",
  //   "is_goal_achieved": false
  // }
  
  return result;
}
```

**Complete Application Example:**
```javascript
// Full implementation: Character selection + conversation
class CharacterApp {
  constructor() {
    this.currentCharacter = null;
    this.conversationHistory = [];
  }
  
  async initializeApp() {
    // Load and display character gallery
    const characters = await loadCharacters();
    this.renderCharacterGallery(characters);
  }
  
  async selectCharacter(cardId) {
    // Get character details and start conversation
    this.currentCharacter = await getCharacterDetails(cardId);
    this.renderCharacterInterface(this.currentCharacter);
  }
  
  async sendMessage(message) {
    // Handle user input and AI response
    const turn = await playTurn(this.currentCharacter.id, message);
    
    this.conversationHistory.push({
      user: message,
      ai: turn.ai_response,
      goalAchieved: turn.is_goal_achieved,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
    
    this.renderConversation();
    
    // Handle goal completion
    if (turn.is_goal_achieved) {
      this.celebrateGoalCompletion();
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.2. Application-Specific Integration Patterns

**Therapy Application Pattern:**
```javascript
// Therapy-focused implementation with mood tracking
class TherapyApp extends CharacterApp {
  async sendMessage(message) {
    // Add mood analysis before conversation
    const moodData = this.analyzeMoodContext(message);
    
    const turn = await playTurn(this.currentCharacter.id, message);
    
    // Store therapeutic progress
    this.recordTherapeuticProgress({
      mood: moodData,
      response: turn.ai_response,
      goalProgress: turn.is_goal_achieved
    });
    
    this.renderTherapyInterface(turn);
  }
}
```

**Educational Game Pattern:**
```javascript
// Education-focused with achievement system
class EducationApp extends CharacterApp {
  async sendMessage(message) {
    const turn = await playTurn(this.currentCharacter.id, message);
    
    // Track learning progress
    if (turn.is_goal_achieved) {
      this.unlockAchievement(this.currentCharacter.id);
      this.updateLearningPath();
    }
    
    this.renderEducationalInterface(turn);
  }
}
```

### 3.3. Error Handling & Production Patterns

**Comprehensive Error Handling:**
```javascript
async function robustApiCall(endpoint, options = {}) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        ...options.headers
      }
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      if (response.status === 404) {
        throw new Error('Character not found');
      } else if (response.status === 429) {
        throw new Error('Rate limit exceeded - please wait');
      } else {
        throw new Error(`API error: ${response.status}`);
      }
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API call failed:', error);
    // Implement retry logic or fallback behavior
    throw error;
  }
}
```
