# Agentic Workflow Hub (Demo-Adapted)

This section documents the AI-driven development process used to build and maintain the Playable Character Cards project. The patterns and protocols described here are part of the showcase, demonstrating a structured, scalable approach to AI-powered software engineering.

## Core Concepts
- **Two-Tier Memory Model**: Agents use the live codebase as "Short-Term Memory" and architectural documentation (like `ARCHITECTURE.md`) as "Long-Term Memory" to guide decisions.
- **"Plan, Execute, Verify" Lifecycle**: A rigorous, structured workflow that ensures quality and architectural compliance for every change.
- **Specialized Agent Roles**: The project is managed by a team of AI agents, each with a specific responsibility, ensuring a separation of concerns.

## Key Documentation
- **[Agent Coordination Protocols](./AGENT-COORDINATION.md)**: Defines the interaction patterns, communication protocols, and quality gates for the multi-agent team. This includes Mermaid diagrams illustrating the workflows.

This workflow is a core part of the project's innovation, enabling rapid, high-quality development while maintaining strict architectural and security standards.
